## Architecture of a typical Rails application

Rails uses the MVC ( Model, View, Controller) architecture to create a webpage. The models, also known as the ActiveRecord, are the objects, in this case, users, posts, comments and images. These models include data fields and types and encloses data in the database which is Postgresql for this application. The view, also known as ActionView, is what the user sees and interacts with, the HTML, CSS and javascript. The controller, also known as ActionController, handles the decisions and processes and responds to events like user action and can make changes the views and the models.

Starting at the browser, the browser communicates to the controller which decides what to do next based on the users' actions. The controller communicates to the model when it needs to which then the using the model can communicate with the database and bring information back and sends the results to the view which will end up getting returned to the browser.
