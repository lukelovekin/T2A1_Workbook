Rails uses the MVC ( Model, View, Controller) architecture to create a webpage. The Models, are referred to as the objects. They contain all the data related logic for the application. The Models interacts with the database, which is where the applications data is stored, and is used for creating, selecting, updating, inserting and deleting data while communicating with the applications controller which can take this data logic and data and renders it to different views. 

The view is what the user sees and interacts with, the user interface logic. Usually used with the HTML, CSS and Javascript to show the visuals and the front end of the application.  The view communicates with the controller to render what parts of the models is seen by the user and when is it to be shown.


The controller handles the decisions and processes and responds to events like user action such as input and can make changes to the views and the models. The controller processes the HTTP requests such as Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete, etc and communicates with both the view and the model, getting data from the model and passing the data to the view.

Starting at the browser, the browser communicates to the controller which decides what to do next based on the users' actions. The controller communicates to the model when it needs to which then, using the model, can communicate with the database and bring information back and sends the results to the view which is then taken by the controller and gets returned to the browser using.
